How to build the manual
-----------------------
The initial model was built with Lego Digital Designer (LDD). (http://ldd.lego.com/)
It was then exported to .ldr file
Then it was opened in Bricksmith (or LDraw)
where each step of the manual was described. (http://www.ldraw.org/)
The manual itself was made with LPub using this tutorial "http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=83642"

There were some issues because of LSynth to render the cables.
I could not manage to display nxt cables so I used an other kind of cables
which look very similar.
