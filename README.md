NXT-Sketcher is a Lego NXT robot that is gifted in drawing.

It can be built from a single standard Lego NXT Mindstorms set.

The robot is able to draw most of svg files.

# Resources

## Where to find .svg files?

[The Noun project](https://thenounproject.com/) contains a large set of high quality free svg files - distributed with a Creative Commons license.
These files work very well with the NXT-Sketcher.

As svg is a standard file format, you can also find many of them through a Google search.

You can even convert your .jpg, .png or .gif files to .svg with online converters such as http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg

## What pen should I use?

I personally use [Muji mini hexagonal pens](http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&Sub=53&PID=6554).
But almost any kind of pen will work.

The [Ev3 Print3rbot](http://www.ev3dev.org/projects/2015/05/06/EV3-Print3rbot/) was a great source of inspiration for the desig of the NXT-Sketcher.
And I am very admirative of his design.
